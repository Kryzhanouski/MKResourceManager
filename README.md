MKResourceManager
=================

The MKResourceManager class enables you to perform many generic file operations  and provides an abstraction from the underlying file system. Primary aim of the resource manager is to handle binary files.  If there is a direct URL to a resource on the backend, that data can be fetched by simply calling downloadResourceForNSURL: on the manager.
